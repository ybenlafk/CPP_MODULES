In C++, the try-catch construct is implemented using a combination of compiler-generated code and runtime support.
At a high level, the try-catch statement allows you to handle exceptions that might be thrown during program execution.

When the C++ compiler encounters a try-catch block in your code, it generates low-level code that sets up a special data structure called the exception frame. 
This data structure contains information about the current state of the program,
including the current function call stack and any variables that are currently in scope.

When an exception is thrown, the runtime system uses the information stored in the exception frame to determine which catch block should be
executed to handle the exception. This process is called stack unwinding, and it involves unwinding the call stack until a suitable catch block is found.

Once a catch block is found, the runtime system jumps to that block and executes the code inside it.
The catch block can access the exception object that was thrown and can use this information to handle the error in an appropriate way.

Once the catch block has finished executing, control is returned to the point in the program where the exception was thrown,
and the program continues executing as normal.

In summary, the try-catch construct in C++ is implemented using a combination of compiler-generated code and runtime support.
The compiler generates low-level code that sets up a special data structure called the exception frame,
which is used by the runtime system to handle exceptions that might be thrown during program execution.
